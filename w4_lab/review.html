                <p>The movie <em>The Cat In The Hat</em> is one of our generations greatest films of all time. The film is the story of Conrad and Sally tired of being left at home with boriong babysitters. In comes <em>The Cat in The Hat</em>. The Cat, played by Mike Myers, is by far the best character in the whole movie. From crazy adventures, trouble, adult humor, and Dr. Seuss flow rhymes, Mike Myers is able to keep the viewer on  their toes. While initialy the movie starts off slow with the story of Conrad Sally having behavioral issues with their mother. The Cat makes it his goal to teach these kids a lesson while having fun. </p>

                <p>Some of the best moments of the movie were during the small gag scenes. For example, when the car explained his vehicles named S.L.O.W. or the SUPER LUXURIOUS OMNIDIRECTIONAL WHATCHAMAJIGGER after originally be called the Super Hydraulic Instantaneous Transporter. As well as the shamless Universal Studios plug that was an node to Wayne's World </p>
